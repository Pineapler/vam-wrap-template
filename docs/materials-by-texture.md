# Materials by Texture
When wrapping, a separate texture transfer must be generated for each destination (G2 female) texture. If you're not using some parts of the model, some textures may not get written to. These have been listed below.
Use the Materials tool in Polygon Selection to create a subset of polygons contains only one texture.
